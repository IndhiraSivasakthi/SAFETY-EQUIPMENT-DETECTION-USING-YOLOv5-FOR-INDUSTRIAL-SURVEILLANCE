# SAFETY-EQUIPMENT-DETECTION-USING-YOLOv5-FOR-INDUSTRIAL-SURVEILLANCE


## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for detecting safety equipment on workers in industrial environments such as oil rigs, refineries, and construction sites. Using **YOLOv5**, a state-of-the-art object detection model, the system automatically identifies whether personnel are wearing essential safety gear like helmets, vests, gloves, and masks, enhancing workplace safety and compliance monitoring.

## Features

- Real-time detection of multiple safety equipment types  
- High accuracy and fast inference using YOLOv5  
- Can be integrated with surveillance cameras for continuous monitoring  
- Alerts for missing or improper safety gear  
- Supports static images  

---

## Dataset

The model is trained on the **Roboflow PPE Dataset**, which includes annotated images of workers wearing various safety equipment. Data augmentation techniques were used to improve model robustness.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- YOLOv5 (Ultralytics implementation)  
- OpenCV for image/video processing  
- Roboflow Dataset for training data  
- Google Colab (optional) for training and testing

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation Metrics
After training the YOLOv5 model for 50 epochs, the following evaluation metrics were obtained:

| **Metric**        | **Value** |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| **Precision (P)** | 0.818     |
| **Recall (R)**    | 0.632     |
| **mAP\@0.5**      | 0.682     |
| **mAP\@0.5:0.95** | 0.317     |

Precision measures the modelâ€™s accuracy in correctly identifying safety equipment (PPE), minimizing false positives.

Recall reflects the modelâ€™s ability to detect all actual PPE instances, minimizing false negatives.

mAP (mean Average Precision) is a standard object detection metric evaluating both precision and recall across different thresholds.

mAP@0.5: Average precision at Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5.

mAP@0.5:0.95: Average precision averaged over multiple IoU thresholds (more stringent evaluation).
